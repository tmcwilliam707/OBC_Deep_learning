    "# Feature Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that I have an idea about past power usage, and common patterns, and the relationships among meter readings and `Global_active_power` from the EDA notebook, I am ready to move on to feature engineering: transforming this into a full training dataset for an ML model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature engineering is all about working with existing data to create helpful variables for your predictive goal. In the most ideal case, you will not need to do much of this at all, but it is often a really important step in creating the best, input features for prediction. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the rest of this notebook, I will go through the following steps: \n",
    ">1. **Loading the data**: Loading the data in as a DataFrame\n",
    "2. **Cleaning the data**: Getting clean data by using code I created in the EDA notebook for dealing with nan's + re-sampling\n",
    "3. **Train/test split**: Splitting the clean data into train/test sets\n",
    "4. **Creating features**: Transforming data and creating new input features that I think will have predictive power\n",
    "5. **Saving data**: Saving my transformed data so I can later load it for model training! (And un-mounting Trove data.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like how exploring data was an iterative process, so is feature engineering. \n",
    "\n",
    "I often find it useful to start with just a few basic features, use these for training an ML/DL model, and only return to create more features and add complexity, once I've learned from those initial training runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by loading in the usual resources."
